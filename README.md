  <p><a href="https://haxe.org">Haxe</a> externs for <a href="https://docs.tizen.org/application">Tizen SDK APIs!</a></p>
</div>

<br>

The goal of this is to allow to write applications leveraging [Tizen SDK APIs](https://docs.tizen.org/application) using [Haxe](https://haxe.org), Which makes coding more fun with the strong typing and Haxe possibilites with no hassle!

Currently the externs only targets JavaScript (To create Tizen Web Applications), But gonna work on .NET and Native externs in near future if possible!

### Install and Usage

1. To install hxtizen just use command `haxelib install hxtizen` and make sure you have Haxe and Tizen development tools installed!

2. Use Tizen Studio's IDE/CLI to create new project for Tizen and currently select "Web Application"

3. Create Haxe project and in your main Haxe file import hxtizen with following way:

```haxe
import tizenjs.Tizen; // Import Tizen's Web API fully!
```

4. OK, Time to code someting in your Tizen App!

```haxe
package;

import haxe.Int64;
import tizenjs.Tizen;

class Main {
    public static function Main() {
        var downloadRequest: DownloadRequest = new DownloadRequest("http://download.tizen.org/tools/README.txt", "downloads");

        Tizen.systeminfo.getPropertyValue("NETWORK", function(networkInfo: SystemInfoNetwork) {
            if (networkInfo.networkType == "NONE") {
                trace("Network connection is not available, Download is not possible.");
                downloadRequest = null;
            }
        });

        var listener: DownloadCallback = {
            /* When the download progresses (interval is platform-dependent) */
            onprogress: function(id: String, receivedSize: Int64, totalSize: Int64) {
                trace("Received with id: " + id + ", " + receivedSize + "/" + totalSize);
            },
        
            /* When the user pauses the download */
            onpaused: function(id: String) {
                trace("Paused with id: " + id);
            },
        
            /* When the user cancels the download */
            oncanceled: function(id: String) {
                trace("Canceled with id: " + id);
            },
        
            /* When the download is completed */
            oncompleted: function(id: String, fullPath: String) {
                trace("Completed with id: " + id + ", full path: " + fullPath);
            },
        
            /* When the download fails */
            onfailed: function(id, error: WebAPIError) {
                trace("Failed with id: " + id + ", error name: " + error.name);
            }
        };

        var downloadId: Int64 = Tizen.download.start(downloadRequest, listener);
        
        // To cancel the download uncomment line below! ^_^
        //Tizen.download.cancel(downloadId);
    }
}
```

5. Add `<tizen:privilege name=" http://tizen.org/privilege/download"/>` to `config.xml` in your Tizen project!

6. OK, Add `-L hxtizen` to your project build HXML file.

7. Build targeting JavaScript platform with JavaScript output to any path in your build HXML file!

8. In your Tizen's main HTML file (Or in your HTML files), Add `<script>` elements linking JavaScript output generated by Haxe!

9. Build in Tizen Studio's IDE/CLI and have fun!

### Differences from JavaScript

1. Creating stuff via constructors now is done without `tizen.<class/object>`, example: `tizen.DownloadRequest` is `DownloadRequest` in hxtizen!

2. API starts with uppercase, So it's `Tizen` instead of `tizen` to comply with Haxe stuff! ^_^

### NOTES

1. .NET and Native (C/C++) targets are into my ideas and planned, But idk when would be done!

2. [TAU](https://samsung.github.io/TAU) is not available yet in JavaScript target due to being poorly documented (But i have partially-externed it so i might work on it in near future)
